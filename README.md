# ðŸ§¾ Customer Value Analysis (SQL Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

In this project, I analyzed customer purchasing behavior using a relational e-commerce dataset. I created a summary of each customerâ€™s total spending, number of orders, average order value, and shopping frequency. Customers were then segmented into value tiers (High, Medium, Low) based on their spending. This type of analysis supports decision-making in marketing, retention, and revenue targeting.
